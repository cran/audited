Description: Classifies a data.frame such that row deletions and
    additions are tracked.  A mechanism exists to give formal names to the row
    subsets that are coming or going.  These names are used to populate a
    directed graph giving an account of all the transactions contributing to
    the state of the data.frame.  The generic as.audited() has a
    method for keyed data.frames that creates an audited data.frame.
    Methods exist that track row count changes for the generics: Ops, !, ^, |,
    [, subset, head, tail, unique, cast, melt, aggregate, and merge.
    audit() extracts the transaction table from the audited object, while
    write.audit() and read.audit() control exchange with the
    file system. An audit method for as.igraph() creates a graph object that
    can be displayed with the corresponding plot method.  Use options(audit= ) 
    to provide an extra level of classification. Use options(artifact=TRUE) 
    and as.xlsx() to save dropped records to file.
